What dataset(s)?
What do you hope to find/hypothesis?
Business case?
What methods/tools do you think work best for your data/questions (etc.)? 
Short and sweet works as long as it reads as thorough and thought through.

The dataset I am planning to use is from work. It contains data about all the bicycles purchased in the last few years, including key variables such as: day, year, season, time of day, price that the bike was purchased for, if the customer had shopped at the store before, and any sale/promotion that was going on. Using this dataset, I hope to be able to construct a better system for determining when to issue a promotion or sale on a group of bikes based on the dataset. A sale on a certain group of bicycles is promoted in order to attract customers. However, there are times when sales are inefficient, in the sense that a customer was already going to buy a bike, regardless of the promotional sale. My goal is to build a model to determine the most effective times for issuing a promotional sale. This will ideally save the company money, by allowing us to make smarter decisions. I have not committed to one type of model yet, but I am thinking of either using Lasso/Ridge regression or a decision tree. If I used Lasso/Ridge regression, I would build a model to determine the influence of the season (time of the year) and any promotional sale that was taking place during the time on how many of those bikes were sold (I would do this for each type of bike we carry: road, mountain, hybrid, kids, etc). By doing so, I would be able to see the influence a promotional sale has on the number of bicycles sold depending on the season or what type of bike it was. The second model I could use is a decision tree. I would use a decision tree to break down the data and see how I can categorize it based on the variables I have in the data. I am still in the process of obtainin this dataset from my company. It exists but I am in the process of making sure that the data is easily readable.

I have a couple of backup plans in case this one either does not work out or is not interesting enough, but this is 
probably my preference.
